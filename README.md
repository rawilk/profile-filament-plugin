This package provides a [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/) plugin for a user profile. The plugin acts as a starting point for your user profile, and provides
multi-factor authentication, password management, session management, and more. A lot of the boilerplate code that is required for these functionalities
is taken care of by this plugin.

Although this package is highly opinionated in how it handles many things, it is still flexible and customizable in most areas.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require rawilk/profile-filament-plugin
```

You can publish and run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="profile-filament-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="profile-filament-config"
```

You can view the default configuration here: https://github.com/rawilk/profile-filament-plugin/blob/main/config/profile-filament.php

## Usage

In a panel service provider, register the plugin:

```php
use Rawilk\ProfileFilament\ProfileFilamentPlugin;

class AdminPanelProvider extends PanelProvider
{
    public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
    {
        return $panel
            // ...
            ->plugin(
                ProfileFilamentPlugin::make()
            );
    }
}
