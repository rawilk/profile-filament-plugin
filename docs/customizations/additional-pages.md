## Introduction

While the plugin offers a decent starting point, you may find yourself needing to add additional profile pages, depending on your application's requirements. This documentation page will detail the process and requirements for adding your own profile pages.

## Define Your Page

First, you need to define a page class. Your page class should extend Filament's `Page` component. In this package, we are making use of Filament's [Clusters](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/panels/clusters) feature, so you'll need to define the `Profile::class` as your page's `$cluster` (see example below).

Here's a simple example of a custom page you can define:

```php
namespace App\Filament\Pages;

use Filament\Pages\Page;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable;
use Rawilk\ProfileFilament\Concerns\HasPanelPageRoutes;
use Rawilk\ProfileFilament\Filament\Clusters\Profile;

class Notifications extends Page
{
    use HasPanelPageRoutes;

    protected static string $view = 'filament.pages.notifications';

    protected static ?string $cluster = Profile::class;

    protected static ?string $navigationIcon = 'heroicon-o-bell';

    // do not prefix with `profile`, since the cluster's
    // slug will already be prefixed to this slug.
    protected static ?string $slug = 'notifications';

    public static function getNavigationLabel(): string
    {
        return __('Notifications');
    }

    public static function getTitle(): string|Htmlable
    {
        return __('Notifications');
    }
}
```

> {note} If you have multiple panels and are using [different slugs for the profile cluster](/docs/profile-filament-plugin/{version}/customizations/misc#user-content-multiple-panels-notice), it is necessary to use the `HasPanelPageRoutes` trait on your page class, as shown in the example. You may omit this trait if you're not using different custom slugs for each panel.

As long as your page is registered correctly in your panel, the page should automatically be added to the profile's navigation items. If you want to group
your pages together, you can provide a string to the `$navigationGroup` property on your page class.

> {tip} To offer flexibility in custom page placement, we stagger the default page sorts from the package in increments of 10.

> {note} Make sure your panel knows about your page. If your page isn't auto-discovered by your panel, you may need to add it to your panel's `pages`.
